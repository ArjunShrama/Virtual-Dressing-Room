# Virtual-Dressing-Room
The "Virtual Dressing Room" project aims to create an interactive virtual experience that allows users to try on different clothing items virtually, enabling them to see how they would look in various outfits without physically trying them on. This project leverages AR or VR technologies to enhance the shopping experience.
